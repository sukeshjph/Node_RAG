Azure Cognitive Search Document Ingestion

This is a sample document that will be processed by the Azure Function for document ingestion. The function will automatically:

1. Read this text content
2. Split it into chunks of approximately 500 tokens
3. Generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI
4. Upload the processed chunks to Azure Cognitive Search

The ingestion process includes:
- Text chunking with overlap for better context preservation
- Dual embedding generation (chat and product vectors)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring

This sample demonstrates how the Azure Function can process various types of text documents and make them searchable through Azure Cognitive Search.

Key features of the ingestion pipeline:
- Automatic blob trigger when files are uploaded
- Support for multiple file formats (starting with .txt)
- Configurable chunk sizes and overlap
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

The function is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of support for PDF files, Word documents, and other formats in the future.
